It belongs to a class of drugs known as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which work by relaxing blood vessels and allowing blood to flow more easily, thereby lowering blood pressure.\\n\\nThis medication comes in the form of a tablet and is typically taken once a day, with or without food. The recommended starting dose is 40 mg, but your doctor may adjust the dose based on your individual response to the medication.\\n\\nTelmisartan 40 mg is a long-acting medication, meaning it stays in the body for a longer period of time compared to other ARBs. This allows for once-daily dosing and may improve medication adherence.\\n\\nHigh blood pressure is a common condition that can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. Telmisartan 40 mg helps to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases.\\n\\nIn addition to its blood pressure-lowering effects, telmisartan 40 mg may also have other benefits. It has been shown to improve kidney function in patients with diabetes and may also help to prevent the progression of kidney disease.\\n\\nSome common side effects of telmis'"
